feat(phase-2): Replace Helius with Magic Eden for NFT verification

BREAKING CHANGE: Complete system overhaul from Helius-based to Magic Eden-based NFT verification

Major Changes:
- Replaced Helius RPC API with Magic Eden collection-based API
- Removed dependency on local metadata files (/metadata directory)
- Implemented config-driven collection management via config/collections.js
- Direct class attribute extraction from Magic Eden (no URI fetching needed)

New Features:
- Added getNftsFromCollectionByWallet() for Magic Eden collection filtering
- Added checkNftOwnershipWithClass() for class-based NFT verification
- Added extractClassFromMetadata() for class attribute extraction
- Centralized collection configuration in config/collections.js
- Support for 15 Realmkin classes: King, Queen, Wizard, Warrior, Rogue, Cleric, Mage, Priest, Chef, Butler, Noble, Jester, Chief, Witch, Knight

Improvements:
- 97% reduction in API calls per verification (31 → 1 call)
- Faster verification process (single API call per collection)
- Simplified configuration (no metadata files needed)
- Better maintainability (easy to add new collections)
- More flexible role assignment system

Files Modified:
- services/periodicVerification.js: Complete rewrite with Magic Eden integration
- utils/solana.js: Added new Magic Eden functions
- config/collections.js: New centralized collection config
- setup_realmkin_roles.md: Updated documentation

Files Added:
- PHASE_2_IMPLEMENTATION.md: Comprehensive technical documentation

Files Removed:
- Metadata loading logic (loadMetadata, specialRoles Map)
- Old Helius-based verifyNFTOwnership
- Test files (consolidated into test_periodic_verification.js)

Testing:
- Verified with real wallet data (15 NFTs)
- Tested quantity-based rules (1+, 3+, 5+)
- Tested trait-based rules (Knight, Chef, Queen, etc.)
- Confirmed class extraction and role assignment working correctly

Performance:
- API calls reduced from ~31 to 1 per user verification
- No breaking changes to database schema
- Backward compatible with existing Discord commands
- Ready for production deployment
